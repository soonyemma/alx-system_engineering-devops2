# Web stack debugging #0

This is the first in a series of web stack debugging projects. Here, with the broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers provided, I was tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state. For each
task. I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the
web stack.

## Task :page_with_curl:

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a
  web server and gets it to respond to queries to the root.
